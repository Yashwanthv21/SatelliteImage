# SatelliteImage
Detecting swimming pools, solar panels, etc from satellite images

## Runtime env
These notebooks are run on Google colaboratory using python3 and GPU env

## Articheture
Uses a Vgg19 architecture to do transfer learning.

## Data
The data used to train is a labelled Australian Swimming pool dataset
The data used to test is scraped from Google Satellite images

## Future Enhancements
- Instead of Image Classification we could perform Object Recognition
- The process can be generalized to use on any scenario and detect objects of various kinds like Solar panels etc

## Real world use cases
- Can be used to count objects from the sky
- Natural Calamities
- Many more possibilities
